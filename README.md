## Ghost blog @ Nodejitsu

Tiny wrapper aroud the Ghost blog enabling deployment to Nodejitsu. The goal of
this wrapper is to persist the content of both the `sqlite` database and `content`
directory. Currently this persistance is done throught MongoDB.

### How to use

1. Clone this module via github or download a release directly from the interface.
```
git clone git@github.com:nodejitsu/nodejitsu-ghost.git
```
2. Create MongoDB database via webops interface or jitsu CLI and add the
   connection string to 'config.js'.
```
exports.mongo = 'mongodb://nodejitsu:7f812389821312fd3192545fd9@paulo.mongohq.com:10051/nodejitsudb12938192';
```
3. Create/add an e-mail service configuration (optional) to 'config.js'.
```
exports.mail = {
  transport: 'SMTP',
  options: {
    auth: {
      user: 'youremail@gmail.com',
      pass: 'yourpassword'
    }
  }
}
```

Other required options are configured automatically post-deployment.

### Disclaimer
To overcome the file persistance problem, user content is persisted to mongoDB.
Hacky? Yes we know, however it is a quick fix for which we had the resources.

If we can find the resources we'd like to build plugins for ghost. Plugings that
will use mongoDB for database storage and/or storage providers for content. If
you would like to help us out, check out [pkgcloud] to get started.
Although We expect the module to work properly, this package is provided "AS IS",
